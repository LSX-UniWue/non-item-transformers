# Project Code Overview #
After installing the virtual environment as described in the [Project Overview](./project_overview.md) setup your IDE
to use the virtual enviroment generated by Poetry. It is commonly found under `recommender/venv/recommender`.

The project is structured into 14 folders:
* [data](./../data): Contains code regarding the indexing of data sets and reading of stored indices
* [dataset](./../dataset): Contains code regarding the integration of data sets into the framework
* [dm](./../dm): Contains code for the use of the dota data set as a pytorch lightning data module
* [docs](./../docs): Contains Markdown files which contain the documentation for this project
* [k8s](./../k8s): Contains a dockerfile which defines a docker container which runs a model when started, an example 
    for a  kubernetes job and pod configuration for said dockerfile.
* [logger](./../logger): Contains code for the logging of pytorch training loss and pytorch training metrics
* [losses](./../losses): Contains code regarding custom loss functions which can be integrated into pytorch training
* [metrics](./../metrics): Contains code reagarding the implementation of recommendation metrics which are integrated 
    using pytorch
* [models](./../models): Contains pytorch implementations of the models provided by this framework
* [modules](./../modules): Contains pytorch-lightning wrappers for the pytorch models defined in [models](./../models)
* [projects](./../projects): Contains yaml files which are needed to configure the uses of models in conjunction with
    metrics and data sets.
* [runner](./../runner): Also contains Typer-CLI implementation for indexing data sets, but also the Typer-CLI
    implementation for training a model and performing predictions with it, as well as necessary support-code
* [tests](./../tests): Contains unit tests for the project. Also contains an example data set as well as the respective
    vocabulary and index file
* [tokenization](./../tokenization): Contains code concerning the tokenization of session items and the building of a 
    vocabulary for data sets.


## Adding a new Metric ##
The metric needs to be able to handle tensors to be compatible with pytorch.

To implement it go to [metrics/ranking_metrics](./../metrics/ranking_metrics.py) and implement a new metrics class.

## Adding a new Data set ##
All Necessary Files for the integration of data sets can be found under the [dataset folder](./../dataset).

In order to add a new dataset and make it usable you have to implement the following steps:
1. Download the data set or document where it is available
2. Index the data set and create train, validation, test split
3. Create a vocabulary for the data set
4. Integrate those steps into the dataset [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) CLI as a new command under 
[dataset/app/data_set_commands.py](./../dataset/app/data_set_commands.py)

## Adding a new Model ##
In order to add a new model multiple things need to be implemented:
1. The model itself as a pytorch model in [models](./../models)
2. A pytorch lightning module that wraps the torch implementation of your newly implemented model in 
    [modules](./../modules)
3. A configuration container in [runner/util/containers](./../runner/util/containers.py) and the respective
    connection in [runner/run_model](./../runner/run_model.py)

## Things that are not Documented ##
This section lists areas of the project that are not documented/need code comments:
* Contents of the "support-code" in [runner/util](./../runner/util)
* Most methods, classes, and modules

## Refactor proposals ##
* The predition logger callback for pytorch lightning is contained in [runner/util](./../runner/util)
    (I [AL] would expect this to be at [logger](./../logger))
* The code in [runner/util](./../runner/util) is quite extensive and should probably be moved into multiple separate
directories (e.g. [runner/util/containers](./../runner/util/containers.py) could be a directory)
* Every directory deserves its own little README.md describing its purpose, contents, and implementation hints 
    in a few sentences
* If this project aims to become a CLI one day the project structure should represent that by:
    + Either: directories should be structured into commands
    + Or: An app directory should be created in which commands are defined and registered at one central file
* If a class is defined in a file the file should have the same name as the class (e.g., 
    [indexer.py](./../data/base/indexer.py) defines the CsvSessionIndexer class)
* If a file defines multiple classes make it a directory.
* Rename [dm](./../dm) to datamodules or remove it
